# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project Type**: Greenfield
- **Start Date**: 2026-08-15T00:00:00Z
- **Current Stage**: INCEPTION - Requirements Analysis

## Workspace State
- **Existing Code**: No
- **Reverse Engineering Needed**: No
- **Workspace Root**: /Users/gauravsingh/developer/workspace/study/companies/ollive

## Code Location Rules
- **Application Code**: Workspace root (NEVER in aidlc-docs/)
- **Documentation**: aidlc-docs/ only
- **Structure patterns**: See code-generation.md Critical Rules

## Development Workflow
- **Git**: Repository initialized on `main` (baseline commit: Inception phase docs). `.gitignore` excludes AI-DLC framework files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.aidlc-rule-details/`) — deliverable repo only.
- **Branching convention**: One branch per unit of work, e.g. `unit/01-provider-abstraction`. A unit's branch is merged into `main` after its Construction per-unit gate (Code Generation + Build & Test) passes, before starting the next unit's branch. No per-story branches — units already align with AI-DLC's per-unit approval gate.

## Extension Configuration
| Extension | Enabled | Decided At |
|---|---|---|
| Security Baseline | No | Requirements Analysis |
| Resiliency Baseline | No | Requirements Analysis |
| Property-Based Testing | No | Requirements Analysis |

## Stage Progress

### 🔵 INCEPTION PHASE
- [x] Workspace Detection
- [x] Requirements Analysis
- [x] User Stories (13 stories / 6 epics, approved)
- [x] Workflow Planning
- [x] Application Design
- [x] Units Generation (6 units defined, awaiting approval)

### 🟢 CONSTRUCTION PHASE
- **Unit 1 — Provider Abstraction & Auto-Instrumentation** — MERGED to `main`
- **Unit 2 — Chatbot Spine** — MERGED to `main` (33/33 tests, verified end-to-end via real Docker Compose stack)
- **Unit 3 — Ingestion Pipeline Hardening** — MERGED to `main` (48/48 tests, verified end-to-end through the live API with a real Gemini error flowing all the way to a `logs` row)
- **Unit 4 — Observability Dashboard** (branch: `unit/04-observability-dashboard`)
  - [x] Functional Design (unified `/metrics` endpoint, defaults/validation, aggregate access scope)
  - [ ] NFR Requirements — IN PROGRESS (logs table indexing decision lands here, now that query_window's shape is concrete)
  - [ ] NFR Design — TBD
  - [ ] Infrastructure Design — TBD
  - [ ] Code Generation
- [ ] Units 5-6 — not yet started
- [ ] Build and Test (after all units complete)

### 🟡 OPERATIONS PHASE
- [ ] Operations — PLACEHOLDER

## Current Status
- **Lifecycle Phase**: CONSTRUCTION
- **Current Stage**: Unit 4 (Observability Dashboard) — Functional Design complete, NFR Requirements next
- **Next Stage**: NFR Requirements for Unit 4
- **Status**: In progress
